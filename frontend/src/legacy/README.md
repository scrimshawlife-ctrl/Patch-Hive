# Legacy frontend surfaces

Unrouted MVP-excluded pages and clients. **Not imported by `App.tsx`.**

| Path | Former product surface |
|------|------------------------|
| `pages/Feed.tsx` | Community feed |
| `pages/Publish.tsx` | Publishing wizard |
| `pages/Publication.tsx` | Public publication |
| `pages/Gallery.tsx` | Publication gallery |
| `pages/LeaderboardsModules.tsx` | Module leaderboards |
| `apiClients.ts` | `communityApi` / `publishingApi` / `leaderboardsApi` |

Backend routers remain behind `ENABLE_LEGACY_*` flags. Do not re-link these pages without flag review and a product decision.
