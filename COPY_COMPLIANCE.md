# Copy Compliance

## Required Canon Copy Used
- "PatchHive is free to explore. You only pay when you export something you want to keep."
- "You’ll receive free credits if your friend makes their first purchase."

## Forbidden Terms Scan
Checked the dashboard/referral copy in `frontend/src/pages/Account.tsx`.
- Forbidden terms not used: upgrade, premium, pro, subscribe, commission, affiliate.

## Notes
- Credits section uses neutral terms only (credits, balance, history).
- Referral copy uses non-monetary framing and follows the canon referral line.
