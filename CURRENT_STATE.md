## OBSERVED product posture

| Area | State |
|------|--------|
| Product identity | Deterministic Eurorack **rig + patch documentation** |
| Canonical domain | `backend/canon/` (+ design recipes, export fulfillment) |
| Design Engine flags | **Default off** — staging overlay + walkthrough PASS (#147) |
| Alembic | Single head through `20260726_module_registry_slugs`; entrypoint waits for DB then upgrades |
| Health | `/health` liveness; `/health/ready` includes DB |
| Local Compose staging | `docker-compose.staging.yml` + `scripts/staging/*` + `scripts/test/run.*` |
| Test automation | `scripts/test/run.sh\|ps1` · CI `acceptance-tests.yml` · 11 acceptance PASS |
| Dual-path inventory | F0/F1/F3/F2 done; F4/F5 residual; Z deferred |
| Named staging host | Plan only — **NOT_PERFORMED** |
| Payments | Test-mode only |
| Production deploy | **Not performed** |
| Production readiness | **Not ready** (beta-staging engineering) — [assessment](docs/evidence/PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_2026-07-21.md) · [matrix](docs/evidence/PRODUCTION_READINESS_MATRIX.md) · [delta](docs/evidence/PRODUCTION_READINESS_DELTA_2026-07-26.md) |

## Immediate continuation priorities

1. Operator: pick named staging host; optional domain cutover ([DOMAIN_CUTOVER_CHECKLIST.md](docs/evidence/DOMAIN_CUTOVER_CHECKLIST.md)).
2. Dual-path F4 (evidence alias) / F5 (FE inventory reads prefer canon DTO).
3. P1/P2 hygiene per CONTINUATION; #96 UI polish when ready.

**Local staging automation:**  
`scripts/test/run.ps1 ci` · `staging` · smoke · acceptance (11 PASS) · design-engine (export succeeded)

## Authority boundary

**Do not:** deploy production, enable live Stripe, charge users, or activate hardware without separate operator authorization.
