# Vision evaluation fixtures

**License:** synthetic internal fixtures only — not a production dataset.  
**Version:** `vision-eval.v1`

## Purpose

Provide a **deterministic** evaluation harness for CI:

- module detection precision/recall when labels exist
- explicit `NOT_COMPUTABLE` for production accuracy metrics

Do **not** publish fixture scores as product accuracy.

## Layout

```text
manifest.json
<sample_id>/
  image.bin          # bytes fed to VisionProviderContext
  labels.json        # ground truth modules/manufacturers
  recorded_packet.json  # optional fixture provider packet
```

## Run

```bash
cd backend
env -u PYTHONPATH python -m pytest tests/unit/test_vision_evaluation.py -q
```

## Decision Intelligence extension

Decision Intelligence reuses this corpus rather than creating a parallel dataset.

- `corpus-contract.json` records the admission contract for representative real-world cases.
- Existing samples remain synthetic CI fixtures only.
- Real-world development, validation, locked-test, adversarial/degraded, and unknown/open-set partitions are not yet admitted.
- Device Registry records may define candidate IDs, but operator-reviewed case labels remain the evaluation ground truth.
- Exact identity candidate sets must preserve an explicit `none_of_above` path.
- Production thresholds remain `NOT_COMPUTABLE` until a representative licensed corpus and SHA-pinned evaluation receipt exist.
